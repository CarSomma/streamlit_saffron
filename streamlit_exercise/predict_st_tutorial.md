# Streamlit Oracle 🔮: How 'Heavy' are Penguins?
Are you exited 😎 for the last 🗿 milestone?

Copy the entire code from the file [predict.py](../warmup_exercises/predict.py) into the empty predict.py in the folder [pages](./pages/predict.py)

You know what makes a good DS WebApp 🌶️🐠, so for the __predict__ web page: 
1. Give an appealing Title 
2. Introduce the page and set the mood. Add some emojis for a playful touch!
2. Provide information about the model you're using. 
3. Create a sidebar for user input. Use sliders and select boxes for flipper length, species, and sex
4. Display the prediction result

🎉Congratulations on creating your very own Penguin WebApp 🐧✨. It's impressive to see you set up a Multipage Streamlit app for EDA and predicting penguin body mass. 🚀👏
