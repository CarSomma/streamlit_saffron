# Streamlit Oracle 🔮: How 'Heavy' are Penguins?
Are you exited 😎 for the last 🗿 milestone?

Copy the entire code from the file [predict.py](../warmup_exercises/predict.py) into the empty predict.py in the folder [pages](./pages/predict.py). Make sure to give the pathname (relative to the current working folder, this is, the folder containing app.py.) of the pickled file *model_penguins.pkl* contained in the folder [pages](./pages/model_penguins.pkl).  

You know what makes a good DS WebApp 🌶️🐠, so for the __predict__ web page: 
1. Give an appealing Title 
2. Introduce the page and set the mood. Add some emojis for a playful touch!
2. Provide information about the model you're using. 
3. Create a sidebar for user inputs. Replace the hardcoded values for flipper length, species, and sex with sliders, and select boxes respectively.
4. Display the prediction result.

🎉Congratulations on creating your very own Penguin WebApp 🐧✨. It's impressive to see you set up a Multipage Streamlit app for EDA and predicting penguin body mass. 🚀👏
