# Streamlit Tutorial: Exploring the PalmerPenguins Dataset
🙌🏼 You made it so far 🛹 🗿!!! 

You have:
+ Gained some basics 🔋 on [Streamlit](streamlit.md)
+ Recapped some basics on 📈📊 [EDA](../warmup_exercises/README.md#data-analysis-📈📊-on-palmerpenguins-🐧) with pandas/matplolib/seaborn
+ Recapped how to use a 🔮 [pretrained model](../warmup_exercises/README.md#model-prediction-🔮-on-palmerpenguins-🐧) with sklearn

🥳🕰️ Time to build a 🐧 Web-App with Streamlit based on the [penguins exercise](../warmup_exercises/README.md#data-analysis-📈📊-on-palmerpenguins-🐧). 


Before we start, ensure you have activated your [Streamlit environment](../README.md#environment-🌀-and-installation-👩🏽‍🔧👨🏽‍🔧).

## Task 1: Create app.py 🐍
In this folder 📁 create a file named app.py. If you want another name feel free to change it 🌶️🐠.

## Task 2: Run app.py 🐍
In the  __terminal__ type:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
🎉🥳 __You have build a streamlit [multipage web app](streamlit.md#multipage-apps)__ hosted locally 🥳🎉 and the only trick is to run __app.py__ and  create a folder named __pages__ containing other python scripts. Building a server, routing and providing the user with a graphical interface are done by Streamlit under the hood. You don't need to have any knowledge of Back-End and Front-End. In this example, we have inserted only one python file, __predict.py__, within pages. Use your web browser to interact with the web app at the url you find in the ouput of your terminal. In the sidebar you can see two links: __app__ and __predict__ but still the web-app looks like an empty canvases. In the next tasks you can find snippet codes for drawing 🎨 on the __app canvas__. 
<br>
While keeping the web-app open in the browser, copy the snippet codes one at the time in the app.py file, save the file and check what changes occur in the web app.

## Task 3: Import Libraries

Import the required libraries for your Streamlit app:

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.express as px
```

## Task 3: Title and Introduction

Set a title for your Streamlit app and provide an introduction to the dataset:
 
```python
# Set the title
st.title("Funfact about penguins🐧")

# Add an image and description
st.image('penguins.png')
st.markdown("This is the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) dataset that describes measurements on penguins")
st.markdown("---")
```

## Task 4: Load and Display Data

Load the penguins dataset and display a sample:

```python
# Load the penguins dataset
df = pd.read_csv("./data/penguins_geo.csv")

# Display a sample of 5 random observations in the dataset
df_sample = df.sample(n=5)
st.header("Penguins 🐧 data")
st.dataframe(df_sample)
st.markdown("**-->Here you can describe your data<--**")
```

## Task 5: User Interaction with Widgets

Allow users to interact with widgets, such as selecting an island to filter the data:

```python
st.subheader("Let's play with the data")

# Create a dropdown menu for selecting an island
island = df['island'].unique()
user_island = st.selectbox(label="Select an Island", options=island)

# Add a checkbox to filter data based on the selected island
if st.checkbox("Do you really want to see the filtered data according to your island?"):
    st.dataframe(df[df['island'] == user_island])
st.markdown("---")
```

## Task 6: Create Scatterplots

Create scatterplots using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly:

### Matplotlib + Seaborn

```python
st.header("Showing 🐧 cases with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly")
st.subheader("🐧 Matplotlib + Seaborn")
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax = sns.scatterplot(
    data=df,
    x='bill_length_mm',
    y='bill_depth_mm',
    hue='species'
)
st.pyplot(fig)
```

### Plotly

```python
st.subheader("🐧 Plotly")
plotly_fig = px.scatter(
    data_frame=df,
    x='bill_length_mm',
    y='bill_depth_mm',
    color='species',
    animation_frame='sex',
)
st.plotly_chart(plotly_fig)
```

## Task 7: Create a Bar Chart

Calculate the average bill length by species and display it as a bar chart:

```python
st.subheader("🐧 Bar Chart")
bill_length_mean = df.groupby(by='species')['bill_length_mm'].mean()
st.bar_chart(bill_length_mean)
```

## Task 8: Geospatial Visualization

Visualize the penguin data on a map:

```python
st.subheader("🐧 Maps 🗺️📍")
st.map(df)
```
## Next 🗿 Milestone
🎉 You have transformed a python script into a Streamlit app 🎉. You will continue drawing 🎨 with Streamlit but on the 🔮[__predict canvas__](predict_st_tutorial.md)
