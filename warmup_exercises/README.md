Two guided fill-in blank exercises come and help you to achieve your 2nd 🗿Milestone:
1. [EDA](#data-analysis-📈📊-on-palmerpenguins-🐧)
2. [Model Prediction](#model-prediction-🔮-on-palmerpenguins-🐧)

For both exercises we use data based on the [palmerpenguins dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).
