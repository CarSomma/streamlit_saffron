# Hi Saffron happy to be here today



1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
You can use venv

```bash
python -m venv streamlit_env
```
This command creates a virtual environment named streamlit_env.

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
On Windows:

```bash
.\streamlit_env\Scripts\activate.ps1
```
On macOS and Linux:

```bash
source streamlit_env/bin/activate
```

3. **Install Streamlit and Additional Libraries:**
Inside the activated virtual environment, you can use pip to install Streamlit and any other libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Test Streamlit Installation:**
You can check if Streamlit is installed correctly and run a sample app with the following command:
```bash
streamlit hello
```
This should open a Streamlit web app in your default web browser.


## Data analysis excercise on penguins
**Business goal:**

*Our marketing team would love to know about the penguins üêß*

Use an editor (e.g., Vscode) to open the file penguins_excercise.py. Read the TODO doc string at the beginning of the file. 

Afterward we will create out of that a nice sort of dashboard using streamlit.
