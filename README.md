# Solution
This branch provides some more advanced Streamlit concepts:
+  `caching data`  --> read the docstring of utils.py,
+  `session state` --> read the docstring of predict_sessionstate.py 
+  `callback function` --> read the docstring of prediction_oncallback.py

## Usage
To run the streamlit app refer to the `EDA_st_tutorial.md` you find in the main branch.
